Server List installation guide for Ubi Soft's Rainbow Six 3-Raven Shield:

1) Open config.inc.php "rvsslwebphp" folder and input your MySQL server data.

2) copy the "rvsslwebphp" to your web server (let us assume you copy it to http://www.yourdomain.com/rvsslwebphp/)

3) Now you need to configure the Server List by going to http://www.yourdomain.com/rvsslwebphp/install.php

4) Delete install.php off your web site after installation.

5) Visit http://www.yourdomain.comn/rvsslwebphp/index.html or http://www.yourdomain.com/rvsslwebphp/serverliste.php to see your Server List.

6) Browser to http://www.yourdomain.com/rvsslwebphp/admin.php and login in with admin/admin.  Be sure to change your password and then configure your Server List.

The admin features and extra data were made possible by the server side mod 'N4Admin' by Neo4E656F! For more information and to download the latest version of the mod on the mod please visit http://www.koalaclaw.com or http://www.tsaf.de.  If you are still using the old version, TATIpDrv, it is not fully compatible with Server List and hence it is strongly recommended you download the latest version of N4Admin, which also contains a new IRC bot.

NB: The Server List works with all servers no matter which beacon they have installed even if it is the original that came with Raven Shield.
